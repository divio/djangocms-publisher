django CMS Publisher
====================

Introduction
------------

django CMS Publisher provides publishing control to models in existing applications.

By default, any saved changes to a model published instantly. django CMS Publisher extends an
application's models so that they exist in *draft* and *published* states, allowing users to work
on unpublished drafts, whether a published version exists yet or not, and publish changes when they
are ready.
